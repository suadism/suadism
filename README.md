## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  I am Suad. Welcome to my page! Thanks for being here 


## About me

I am a hard working and determined data analyst professional who is passionate about storytelling using data. During my 5 career in the pharmaceutical industry I have seen  the increasing impact of data in the industry which piqued my interest. I enjoy uncovering insights from analyzing data and leveraging my skills in SQL, Python and MS Excel. I just completed a Data Science diploma where I mastered Machine learning techniques, Statistical Analysis and Data visualization



## Projects

I developed a tool that takes in the patients vitals and chief complaiant and recommends the emergency/triage level to assist healthcare workers in the ER in triaging incoming patients. This was developed after analyzing hospital records using Natural Language Processing, Supervised Machine learning and data visualization techniques. Take a look below! The healthcare worker can input the patients vitals and the tool churns a triage level within seconds. Take a look at how i developed this tool
